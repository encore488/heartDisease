# heartDisease
A statistical analysis in R. Uses random forests and logistic regression.

Four different analyses done in R. The first two, a simple and a more complex logistic regression model,
help determine the likelihood that a patient will have heart disease. The last two analyses are random forests. The first is for heart disease and the second is for
maximum heart rate achieved. The data set used is heart_disease.csv, but I have also provided heart.csv for anyone that wishes to use it as a testing set or anything else.
