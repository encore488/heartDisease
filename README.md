# heartDisease
A statistical analysis in R. Uses random forests and logistic regression.

This is part of my second Statistics class. It is four different analyses done in R. The first two, a simple and a more complex logistic regression model,
help determine the likelihood that a patient will have heart disease. The last two analyses are random forests. The first is for heart disease and the second is for
maximum heart rate achieved. The data set will also be provided

The code and database can be uploaded into Jupyter Notebooks, where this was all created.
